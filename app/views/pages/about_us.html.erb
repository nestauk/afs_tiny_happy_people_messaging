      About our partners
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-3">
      The Tiny Happy People texting programme was first developed by Professor Danielle Matthews at the University of Sheffield and BBC Education to deliver the free online resources of THP to caregivers to evaluate via a trial if texting THP video resources to families supports caregiver-child interaction and ultimately results in better language outcomes for children.

    <p>
      Since 2024, Nesta has been working in an innovation partnership with Professor Danielle Matthews and BBC Education to further develop the Tiny Happy People (THP) texting programme. Since the beginning of our partnership, Nesta has been working to continue to develop, test, and scale the Tiny Happy People texting programme to reach more parents across the UK and contribute towards our mission goal of breaking the link between family background and life chances.
