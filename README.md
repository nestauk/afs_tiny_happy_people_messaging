# Tiny Happy People text messaging service

Texts video content from BBC's Tiny Happy People to parents

## Getting started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for
development and testing purposes.

###Â Prerequisites

Docker

### Local setup

1. Clone the repo

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.

3. Install Ruby dependencies and start the local development server.
```shell
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

4. Run the database migrations and seed the database
```shell
docker compose exec app.local bash
rails db:schema:load
```

The local development server will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Most features should work locally though for some you may need to add the appropriate credentials -
see the `.env.template` for an example. You may need to set up accounts for the relevant services -
or contact a maintainer for the keys.

### Running tests

- `docker compose exec app.local rails test` to run unit tests.
- `docker compose exec app.local rails test:system` to run system/end-to-end tests.

## Deployment

We currently use Heroku to host and deploy this app.

### Heroku Scheduler

The tasks to send messages to parents are set up using Heroku scheduler. See `scheduler.rake` for those tasks.
